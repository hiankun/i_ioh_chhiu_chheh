This Glossary of Medical Terminology has been <br/>
prepared for the layman, not for the medical pro- <br/>
fessional. Medical dictionaries are available to <br/>
the professional class, whose needs are different. <br/>
This book is for the foreigner who speak Chinese <br/>
and who needs to know words that have reference to <br/>
medicine but are often of a non-technical nature. <br/>
We have found it extremely difficult to compile <br/>
this glossary. The professional class is inclined <br/>
to use the language of its study, English or Japa- <br/>
nese, a practice that does not facilitate good <br/>
communication. Our purpose has been to present a <br/>
medical language that is not only for the layman <br/>
but is of the layman as well, with the result that <br/>
inaccuracies will be found in this vocabulary. It <br/>
simply is a fact that medical language is used <br/>
with varying degrees of accuracy, and that is true <br/>
not only of this country. At the same time, how- <br/>
ever, in order to make this book more comprehen- <br/>
sive, there are included many words, technically <br/>
exact, that the layman will not readily under- <br/>
stand. It is a dilemma that has not been alto- <br/>
gether successfully resolved. We hope we are giv- <br/>
ing you a book without any real mistakes in it <br/>
and without too many really useful words missing.
